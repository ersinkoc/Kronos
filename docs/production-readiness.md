# Production Readiness

Last reviewed from the repository state on April 27, 2026.

Kronos is close to production-ready for the implemented Redis or Valkey backup
path with local or S3-compatible storage. A PostgreSQL logical backup/restore
MVP is now present through `pg_dump` and `psql`, with worker/control-plane/local
repository smoke E2E coverage and real-service PostgreSQL conformance running
in CI. It still needs broader PostgreSQL operational hardening around roles,
extensions, large objects, and deeper restore drills before it should be
treated as a fully production-grade PostgreSQL path. The full product vision
across MySQL,
MongoDB, SFTP, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage, deeper WebUI workflows, and
multi-instance control-plane operation is still roadmap work.

## Readiness Estimate

| Scope | Estimate | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Implemented Redis/local/S3 path | 93% | Core pipeline, agent/server flow, lost-agent recovery, server restart recovery, restore planning, retention, audit, metrics, release scripts, Kubernetes examples, runbooks, a reusable production gate, and tagged worker/control-plane/Redis backup, restore, retention apply, and recovery E2E tests are in place. |
| Broad multi-database product vision | 79% | Redis is executable, PostgreSQL now has a plain SQL logical driver MVP, worker pipeline smoke E2E coverage, CI real-service conformance coverage, and restore guardrails. MySQL, MongoDB, storage backends, WebUI workflows, and multi-instance deployment patterns remain roadmap work. |
| Current repository release hygiene | 93% | Tests, vet, format checks, OpenAPI checks, release artifacts, provenance, SBOM metadata, CI govulncheck, release artifact smoke checks, PostgreSQL service conformance, the production check script, and tagged backup/restore/retention/recovery E2E coverage are present. The `golang.org/x/crypto` advisories are fixed. |

## Current Release Gate

Use this command before a release candidate:

```bash
GO=.tools/go/bin/go ./scripts/production-check.sh
```

The gate checks formatting, runs `go vet`, runs the full Go test suite, builds
the binary, validates shell scripts, validates bash completion syntax, and
executes `kronos version`.

## Production-Ready Strengths

- Core streaming backup pipeline with chunking, compression, encryption
  envelopes, signed manifests, restore planning, and verification.
- Redis/Valkey driver coverage with backup and restore paths.
- PostgreSQL logical driver MVP using `pg_dump` for full backups and `psql` for
  restores, with deterministic command-runner unit tests, tagged worker
  pipeline smoke E2E coverage, CI real-service conformance coverage,
  `replace_existing` enforcement for non-dry-run restores, and
  single-transaction `psql` execution.
- Local and S3-compatible storage backends.
- Persistent control plane state, scheduler state, jobs, backups, retention,
  notifications, users, tokens, and audit log.
- Scoped bearer tokens, role-capped token creation, token lifecycle operations,
  request IDs, security headers, and mutation audit events.
- Health, readiness, metrics, OpenAPI, operations docs, deployment topology
  docs, restore drill docs, release scripts, provenance metadata, SBOM
  metadata, and Kubernetes examples.
- CI runs formatting, vet, staticcheck, govulncheck, race tests, PostgreSQL
  service conformance, release artifact verification, container builds,
  completion syntax checks, and the production-readiness gate. Release
  artifacts are also smoke-tested by executing the host binary and validating
  generated shell completion.
- Tagged E2E coverage exercises a control-plane HTTP server, worker agent,
  local repository storage, and Redis-compatible RESP target together for
  backup and restore. It also covers retention apply over committed backup
  metadata, including dry-run behavior, deletion, and mutation audit recording.
  Lost-agent recovery is covered through heartbeat, claim, failed running job,
  target unblock, and recovery audit behavior. Server restart recovery is
  covered through persisted running/finalizing jobs, boot-time recovery, HTTP
  job inspection, and post-shutdown state verification. PostgreSQL worker smoke
  coverage exercises backup and restore through fake `pg_dump`/`psql` tools,
  the control plane, local storage, manifests, and the restore pipeline:
  `go test -tags=e2e ./cmd/kronos`.

## Blocking Work Before Calling The Whole Product Production-Ready

1. Harden PostgreSQL operational behavior around roles, extensions, large
   objects, and deeper restore failure scenarios.
2. Extend E2E coverage into more retention policy edge cases and release
   provenance signing.
3. Expand the WebUI from dashboard shell into live resource CRUD, job detail,
   backup detail, and restore workflows.
4. Decide the supported multi-instance story for control-plane state, or
   document single-replica constraints as a hard production boundary.
5. Sign or attest release provenance and SBOM metadata in CI.

## Next Engineering Slices

1. Extend PostgreSQL real-service conformance around roles, extensions, large
   objects, and restore failure behavior.
2. WebUI live API wiring for overview, jobs, backups, agents, and readiness.
3. Production deployment hardening for single-replica Kubernetes and external
   secret management.
4. Sign release provenance and SBOM metadata with keyless CI identity.
