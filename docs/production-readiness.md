# Production Readiness

Last reviewed from the repository state on April 27, 2026.

Kronos is close to production-ready for the implemented Redis or Valkey backup
path with local or S3-compatible storage. It is not yet production-ready for
the full product vision across PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SFTP, Azure Blob,
Google Cloud Storage, deeper WebUI workflows, and multi-instance control-plane
operation.

## Readiness Estimate

| Scope | Estimate | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Implemented Redis/local/S3 path | 93% | Core pipeline, agent/server flow, lost-agent recovery, server restart recovery, restore planning, retention, audit, metrics, release scripts, Kubernetes examples, runbooks, a reusable production gate, and tagged worker/control-plane/Redis backup, restore, retention apply, and recovery E2E tests are in place. |
| Broad multi-database product vision | 70% | The architecture is strong, but major drivers, storage backends, WebUI workflows, and multi-instance deployment patterns remain roadmap work. |
| Current repository release hygiene | 92% | Tests, vet, format checks, OpenAPI checks, release artifacts, provenance, SBOM metadata, CI govulncheck, release artifact smoke checks, the production check script, and tagged backup/restore/retention/recovery E2E coverage are present. The `golang.org/x/crypto` advisories are fixed. |

## Current Release Gate

Use this command before a release candidate:

```bash
GO=.tools/go/bin/go ./scripts/production-check.sh
```

The gate checks formatting, runs `go vet`, runs the full Go test suite, builds
the binary, validates shell scripts, validates bash completion syntax, and
executes `kronos version`.

## Production-Ready Strengths

- Core streaming backup pipeline with chunking, compression, encryption
  envelopes, signed manifests, restore planning, and verification.
- Redis/Valkey driver coverage with backup and restore paths.
- Local and S3-compatible storage backends.
- Persistent control plane state, scheduler state, jobs, backups, retention,
  notifications, users, tokens, and audit log.
- Scoped bearer tokens, role-capped token creation, token lifecycle operations,
  request IDs, security headers, and mutation audit events.
- Health, readiness, metrics, OpenAPI, operations docs, deployment topology
  docs, restore drill docs, release scripts, provenance metadata, SBOM
  metadata, and Kubernetes examples.
- CI runs formatting, vet, staticcheck, govulncheck, race tests, release
  artifact verification, container builds, completion syntax checks, and the
  production-readiness gate. Release artifacts are also smoke-tested by
  executing the host binary and validating generated shell completion.
- Tagged E2E coverage exercises a control-plane HTTP server, worker agent,
  local repository storage, and Redis-compatible RESP target together for
  backup and restore. It also covers retention apply over committed backup
  metadata, including dry-run behavior, deletion, and mutation audit recording.
  Lost-agent recovery is covered through heartbeat, claim, failed running job,
  target unblock, and recovery audit behavior. Server restart recovery is
  covered through persisted running/finalizing jobs, boot-time recovery, HTTP
  job inspection, and post-shutdown state verification:
  `go test -tags=e2e ./cmd/kronos`.

## Blocking Work Before Calling The Whole Product Production-Ready

1. Add at least one more first-class database driver, starting with PostgreSQL
   or MySQL, plus backup and restore conformance tests.
2. Extend E2E coverage into more retention policy edge cases and release
   provenance signing.
3. Expand the WebUI from dashboard shell into live resource CRUD, job detail,
   backup detail, and restore workflows.
4. Decide the supported multi-instance story for control-plane state, or
   document single-replica constraints as a hard production boundary.
5. Sign or attest release provenance and SBOM metadata in CI.

## Next Engineering Slices

1. PostgreSQL driver MVP with schema/data backup and restore smoke tests.
2. WebUI live API wiring for overview, jobs, backups, agents, and readiness.
3. Production deployment hardening for single-replica Kubernetes and external
   secret management.
4. Sign release provenance and SBOM metadata with keyless CI identity.
