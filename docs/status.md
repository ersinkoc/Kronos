# Project Status

Last reviewed from the repository state on April 30, 2026.

Kronos is currently a working Phase 1 / early Phase 2 backup platform rather
than a bare scaffold. The core control plane, CLI, state store, scheduler,
agent worker, backup pipeline, restore planning, retention engine, audit log,
OpenAPI contract, operations documentation, and observability surface are in
place and covered by tests.

## Completed Foundations

- Single Go binary with server, local, agent, and administrative CLI modes.
- Embedded kvstore with WAL, B+Tree buckets, repair coverage, and persisted
  control-plane stores.
- Local and S3-compatible storage backends.
- Chunking, deduplication, compression, encryption envelopes, signed manifests,
  and manifest/chunk verification.
- Redis backup and restore driver coverage, including ACL and command-stream
  replay paths.
- PostgreSQL logical driver MVP using `pg_dump` plain SQL output for full
  backups and `psql` for restores, with PostgreSQL 15, 16, and 17 conformance
  coverage plus focused restore rehearsal evidence.
- MySQL/MariaDB logical driver MVP using `mysqldump`/`mysql` with real-service
  MySQL 8.4 and MariaDB 11.4 conformance plus bidirectional restore rehearsal
  coverage.
- MongoDB logical driver MVP using `mongodump`/`mongorestore` archives with
  restore guardrails, failed restore cleanup coverage, authenticated MongoDB
  7.0/8.0 conformance, a MongoDB 7.0 10,000-document restore drill, and a
  MongoDB 7.0 replica-set/oplog recovery drill.
- Persistent scheduler and queued/running/terminal job lifecycle.
- Agent worker resource sync, heartbeat, job claim, backup execution, restore
  execution, and finish reporting.
- REST API for resources, jobs, backups, retention, restore, audit, users, and
  tokens, with checked OpenAPI coverage.
- Restore evidence artifacts are persisted in a dedicated evidence store and
  remain exportable by job ID even when the job record is no longer present.
- Token-based authorization with scoped bearer tokens, role-capped token
  creation, inactive token pruning, request IDs, and audit recording for
  mutations.
- Direct control-plane TLS with optional client-certificate verification for
  agent mTLS enrollment.
- Baseline HTTP security headers for API and embedded WebUI responses.
- Webhook notification rules for terminal job events, config-level multi-channel
  fan-out, scheduled pre-backup/failure hook execution, API management,
  optional HMAC payload signatures, bounded retries, and delivery metadata in
  the audit chain.
- Dashboard-oriented operations overview API with inventory counts, active job
  state, backup totals, readiness state, attention counters, and latest activity
  slices.
- Readiness, health, Prometheus metrics with `GET`/`HEAD` probe support,
  operations docs, CLI docs, quickstart, architecture docs, deployment topology
  guidance, restore drill guidance, multi-platform release artifacts, checksums,
  provenance metadata, SBOM metadata, SBOM module/vulnerability verification,
  release artifact smoke checks, container builds, GitHub release publishing,
  Kubernetes deployment examples with EKS/GKE/AKS overlays, and cloud secret
  integration guidance.

## Verification State

The repository currently passes the full Go test suite:

```bash
.tools/go/bin/go test ./...
```

The production-readiness gate is also available without relying on `make`:

```bash
GO=.tools/go/bin/go ./scripts/production-check.sh
```

This gate checks Go formatting, runs `go vet`, runs the full test suite, builds
the binary, validates shell scripts, validates generated bash completion
syntax, and verifies that `kronos version` can execute. The docs test also
checks local Markdown links, and the OpenAPI package has a checked spec test.
The current explicit `not implemented` markers are
intentional fail-fast boundaries for roadmap database drivers and storage
backends; unsupported capabilities are surfaced early instead of falling
through to ambiguous runtime behavior.

Tagged E2E coverage is available for the implemented worker/control-plane/Redis
backup and restore path, scheduled pre-backup shell/webhook hook execution,
failure hook execution, retention apply metadata pruning, protected backup
retention, retained backup-chain protection, and lost-agent recovery during job
claim. The same tagged suite also covers server restart recovery for active jobs
reopened from persisted state, plus PostgreSQL worker/control-plane/local-storage
backup and restore smoke coverage through fake `pg_dump` and `psql` tools:

```bash
.tools/go/bin/go test -tags=e2e ./cmd/kronos
```

## Known Gaps

See [Production Readiness](production-readiness.md) for the current release
gate, readiness estimate, and next engineering slices.

Kronos is usable for its implemented Redis/local/S3-oriented paths, and now has
PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, and MongoDB logical driver MVPs. It is not yet a
broad multi-database production suite. The largest remaining areas are:

- PostgreSQL operational hardening. Current PostgreSQL driver coverage includes
  command-runner unit coverage over `pg_dump` and `psql`, tagged worker
  pipeline smoke E2E coverage with fake client tools, and CI real-service
  conformance across PostgreSQL 15, 16, and 17 with restore data verification
  for extension-backed data, large objects, indexed JSONB bulk rows, explicit
  `replace_existing=true` guardrails, single-transaction `psql` execution,
  rollback behavior for failed restores, and optional `include_globals=true`
  capture of PostgreSQL role metadata through
  `pg_dumpall --globals-only --no-role-passwords`, including a conformance
  assertion that role password material is not emitted and a focused
  `postgres_globals` restore drill for role metadata. CI also runs a
  PostgreSQL 15-to-17 and 16-to-17 restore rehearsals and a PostgreSQL 17 full
  global restore rehearsal that replays actual globals plus database streams
  into a separate target, plus a PostgreSQL 17 operator-scale restore drill
  that verifies 10,000 indexed JSONB rows across separate source and target
  services. Remaining hardening is around native PITR/WAL coverage and broader
  service-level failure-injection evidence.
- Additional database driver depth. Current executable driver coverage is
  Redis/Valkey, the PostgreSQL logical MVP, a MySQL/MariaDB
  `mysqldump`/`mysql` logical MVP with unit coverage plus real-service MySQL
  8.4 and MariaDB 11.4 conformance for backup/restore of indexed JSON data,
  bidirectional MySQL/MariaDB restore rehearsals, and 10,000-row
  MySQL/MariaDB restore drills, and a MongoDB `mongodump`/`mongorestore`
  archive MVP with unit coverage for restore guardrails and failed restore
  temp-config cleanup, authenticated MongoDB 7.0/8.0 real-service conformance,
  an authenticated MongoDB 7.0 10,000-document restore drill, and unit-covered
  replica-set `--oplog` / `--oplogReplay` command wiring backed by a real
  MongoDB 7.0 replica-set/oplog recovery drill in CI.
- Additional storage backends such as SFTP, Azure Blob, and Google Cloud
  Storage. Current executable backends are local filesystem and S3-compatible
  object storage.
- Deeper WebUI interaction beyond the current authenticated live
  overview/jobs/backups/inventory dashboard plus
  target/storage/schedule/retention/job/backup detail, schedule pause/resume,
  target/storage/schedule/retention create/update editing, guarded target/storage
  deletion, manual backup drill queueing, backup metadata verification,
  byte-level backup verification queueing, verification result display, backup
  verification history, restore preview plus guarded dry-run/live restore
  queueing, restore job history with restore outcome summaries and
  hash-addressed evidence artifacts, job cancel/retry, and backup protection
  actions.
- Richer notification delivery integrations beyond webhooks and shell hooks.
- Broader production hardening around auth integrations and future
  multi-instance operational patterns. The current Kubernetes manifests now
  document and enforce the supported single-replica control-plane boundary.

## Next Best Work

1. Set the `KRONOS_RELEASE_TAG_PUBLIC_KEY` repository secret to the trusted
   armored public GPG key for the release tag signer, run
   `check-release-workflow-prereqs.sh`, and cut the next signed rehearsal or
   production tag to exercise the release workflow evidence upload path.
