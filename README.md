This repository currently has the Phase 0 foundation in place and active Phase
1/early Phase 2 implementation work:

- storage backends: local filesystem and S3-compatible object storage; SFTP,
  Azure Blob, and Google Cloud Storage are domain-level roadmap kinds, not
  executable backends in this build
- crypto/chunk core: FastCDC, BLAKE3 chunk IDs, compression, encryption
  envelopes, dedup index, backup/restore pipeline
- repository metadata: signed manifests, manifest commit/load helpers, manifest
  and chunk-level verification
- embedded state: pure-Go page store, B+Tree, rollback WAL, buckets, repair
- audit: kvstore-backed hash-chained append log with verification and server
  mutation recording
- retention: count, time, size, and GFS policy resolver with JSON plan output
- scheduling: 5-field/6-field cron parser, `@between` windows with stable
  jitter, catch-up policies, per-target queueing, and persisted server-side
  scheduler ticks/background loop
- driver scaffold: generic driver interfaces plus executable Redis/Valkey
  SCAN/DUMP/RESTORE support with ACL snapshot/restore records and JSON command
  stream replay. PostgreSQL has a logical `pg_dump`/`psql` MVP with
  multi-version conformance, 15-to-17 restore rehearsal, and full global
  restore rehearsal coverage in CI, plus a 10,000-row PostgreSQL restore drill.
  MySQL/MariaDB has a `mysqldump`/`mysql` logical MVP with real-service MySQL
  8.4, MariaDB 11.4, and bidirectional MySQL/MariaDB restore rehearsal
  coverage in CI, plus 10,000-row MySQL and MariaDB restore drills. MongoDB
  now has a `mongodump`/`mongorestore` archive MVP with deterministic unit
  coverage, authenticated real-service MongoDB 7.0 conformance, and an
  authenticated 10,000-document MongoDB restore drill in CI.

- backup listing filters by target, storage, type, protection state, and
  timestamp windows such as `--since 7d`
- job listing filters by status, operation, target, storage, agent,
  restore/verification backup ID, and queued time windows
- audit listing, tailing, and searching filters by actor, action, resource, and
  occurred-at windows
- server: config-loading HTTP skeleton with `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`,
  probe-friendly `HEAD` handling, and graceful shutdown
- local mode: starts an embedded control-plane server with local state and can
  run an embedded worker with `--work`
- WebUI: embedded React/Tailwind operations dashboard served by the control
  plane, with live overview/jobs/backups/target/storage data, browser-side
  bearer token support, target/storage/schedule/retention/job/backup detail
  inspection, target/storage/schedule/retention create/update editing, guarded
  target/storage deletion, manual backup drill queueing, backup metadata
  verification, chunk verification queueing, and verification result display,
  backup verification history, restore preview plus guarded dry-run/live
  restore queueing, restore job history with restore outcome summaries and
  hash-addressed failure/evidence artifacts, schedule pause/resume, job
  cancel/retry, and backup protect/unprotect actions, a Vite build pipeline, and
  deployment-safe cache headers
- agent/server: heartbeat endpoint, list/inspect APIs, in-memory agent
  registry, and heartbeat-only or worker-mode agent process
- agent worker: control-plane HTTP client with resource sync, heartbeat, job
  claim, finish reporting, full/incremental backup execution, and restore
  execution
- server state: kvstore-backed job persistence, restart recovery for active
  jobs, independent evidence artifact retention, config-seeded resources,
  `/api/v1/jobs`, claim, finish, and cancel endpoints
- orchestration: scheduler due jobs persist as queued jobs with
  queued/running/terminal lifecycle transitions and backup metadata capture on
  successful finish
- REST API: target, storage, schedule CRUD endpoints and manual
  `POST /api/v1/backups/now`, operations overview at `/api/v1/overview`,
  with a checked OpenAPI spec in `api/openapi/`
- backups API: list/inspect/protect/unprotect, verification job queueing with
  persisted verification reports, verification job filtering, plus server-side
  retention policy CRUD and plan/apply with dry-run support
- restore API: restore preview plans that validate backup parent chains,
  enqueue restore jobs with dry-run and replace-existing restore options, and
  persist restore outcome summaries and independently retained hash-addressed
  evidence artifacts with backup-scoped job filtering and
  `/api/v1/jobs/{id}/evidence` export
- notification API: webhook rule CRUD for terminal job events with optional HMAC
  payload signatures and bounded delivery retries
- token API: scoped API token create/list/verify/revoke/prune with hashed verifier
  storage and copy-once bearer secret output
- user API: local user metadata create/list/get/delete plus role grants
- HTTP hardening: request IDs, no-store control-plane responses, and baseline
  browser security headers for API/WebUI responses

Important driver status: PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, and MongoDB are currently
external-tool driver MVPs, not native wire-protocol implementations. Worker
agents need the corresponding client tools installed. Passwords are no longer
placed in process-visible command arguments for these tool-wrapper paths:
PostgreSQL uses `PGPASSWORD`, MySQL/MariaDB uses `MYSQL_PWD`, and MongoDB uses
a 0600 temporary `--config` file. Native protocol drivers and PITR remain
roadmap work.

## Build

```bash
make build
./bin/kronos version
```

`make build` stamps version metadata from Git when available. Override
`VERSION`, `COMMIT`, or `BUILD_DATE` for reproducible release builds.
`make release` writes a platform-named binary and matching `.sha256` checksum
under `bin/`; `make release-all` writes linux/darwin amd64/arm64 artifacts by
default.

Build and embed the WebUI before producing a UI-enabled binary:

```bash
make ui
make build
```

Container builds use the same stamped metadata:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg VERSION="$(git describe --tags --always --dirty 2>/dev/null || echo dev)" \
  --build-arg COMMIT="$(git rev-parse --short HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)" \
  --build-arg BUILD_DATE="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  -t kronos:local .
```

## Check

```bash
make check
```

In this workspace, a local Go toolchain is available at `.tools/go/bin/go`, so
the equivalent direct check is:

```bash
.tools/go/bin/go test ./...
```

Inspect expanded configuration safely with redacted secret-like fields:

```bash
./bin/kronos --output pretty config inspect --config kronos.yaml
```

Structured command output supports `--output json`, `--output pretty`,
`--output yaml`, and `--output table`; `--output` can be placed before the
command or alongside command flags.
CLI color is enabled only for terminals. Use `--no-color` or `NO_COLOR=1` for
plain output in logs and scripts.

## API Tokens

Bootstrap the first admin user and copy-once admin token, then create narrower
scoped tokens for automation. The bootstrap endpoint only works while both the
user and token stores are empty. After that, the server enforces exact scopes
plus `resource:*`, `admin:*`, or `*`.

```bash
export KRONOS_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN=<random-one-time-bootstrap-secret>
./bin/kronos user bootstrap --id admin --email admin@example.com --display-name Admin --token-name initial-admin --bootstrap-token "$KRONOS_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN"
export KRONOS_TOKEN=<copy-once-admin-secret>
./bin/kronos token create --user admin --name ci --scope backup:read,backup:write
export KRONOS_TOKEN=<copy-once-ci-secret>
./bin/kronos token verify
./bin/kronos --server http://127.0.0.1:8500 --token "$KRONOS_TOKEN" backup list
```

For non-local deployments, configure `server.auth.bootstrap_token` before the
first bootstrap and pass the same value through `--bootstrap-token` or
`KRONOS_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`.

After rotating credentials, preview and prune inactive token metadata:

```bash
./bin/kronos token prune --dry-run
./bin/kronos token prune
```

Common scope families are `backup`, `target`, `storage`, `schedule`, `job`,
`retention`, `restore`, `audit`, `token`, `user`, `agent`, and `metrics`, each
using `:read` or `:write` where applicable. `overview` uses `metrics:read`.
Requested token scopes are capped by the token user's role when the token is
created and by the user's current role on every authenticated request.
The implemented authentication surface is token-only; local password login and
TOTP are intentionally not accepted until that login flow exists.

Agents can use the same bearer secret through `KRONOS_TOKEN` or
`kronos agent --token <secret>` and advertise concurrency with
`--capacity <n>`. Worker agents need `agent:write`, `job:write`,
`target:read`, `storage:read`, and `backup:read` for heartbeat, resource sync,
claim, and finish calls.
For TLS-enabled control planes, use an `https://` server URL. Agents trust a
private server CA with `--tls-ca` or `KRONOS_TLS_CA`, and mTLS enrollment uses
`--tls-cert`/`--tls-key` or `KRONOS_TLS_CERT`/`KRONOS_TLS_KEY`.

Run `kronos agent --work` to claim and execute jobs. Worker mode syncs targets,
storages, and backups from the control plane and needs a manifest signing key
plus a chunk encryption key:

```bash
./bin/kronos keygen --key-id prod-2026
export KRONOS_MANIFEST_PRIVATE_KEY=<ed25519-private-key-hex>
export KRONOS_CHUNK_KEY=<32-byte-hex-key>
./bin/kronos agent --work --server http://127.0.0.1:8500 --token "$KRONOS_TOKEN" --key-id prod-2026
```

Config secret placeholders support environment variables and files, including
structured JSON/YAML selectors such as `${file:secrets.yaml#database.password}`.
When `server.master_passphrase` is configured, sensitive target and storage
option values are encrypted before being written to the control-plane state DB
and decrypted on authorized reads.
Agents also resolve full-value target/storage option placeholders at execution
time, so API-created resources can store `${env:DB_PASSWORD}` or
`${file:/run/secrets/s3.json#secret_key}` instead of raw credential values.
Use CLI helper flags such as `--password-ref`, `--access-key-ref`,
`--secret-key-ref`, `--session-token-ref`, or `--credentials-ref` to create
those references without placing raw resource credentials in command history.
The control plane rejects malformed placeholder syntax on target/storage
create and update requests.

## Verify A Backup Manifest

Manifest existence/signature check:

```bash
./bin/kronos backup verify \
  --manifest manifest.json \
  --public-key <ed25519-public-key-hex> \
  --storage-local /path/to/repo
```

Chunk integrity check, including decrypt/decompress/hash verification:

```bash
./bin/kronos backup verify \
  --manifest-key manifests/2026/04/23/backup-1.manifest \
  --level chunk \
  --chunk-key <32-byte-decryption-key-hex> \
  --public-key <ed25519-public-key-hex> \
  --storage-local /path/to/repo
```

## Repository GC

Dry-run unreferenced chunk collection:

```bash
./bin/kronos gc \
  --storage-local /path/to/repo \
  --public-key <ed25519-public-key-hex> \
  --dry-run
```

## Retention Planning

```bash
./bin/kronos retention plan --input retention-plan.json
```

The input JSON contains `policy`, `backups`, and an optional `now` timestamp.
The output marks each backup as kept or droppable with rule reasons.
