# Kronos Architecture

Kronos is a zero-dependency Go backup platform for scheduled, encrypted, verified database backups. The repository is currently beyond a skeleton: it contains the core CLI, a control-plane HTTP server, embedded state storage, scheduler orchestration, agent workers, backup and restore pipelines, manifest verification, retention planning, audit logging, webhook notifications, local and S3-compatible storage backends, Redis driver support, a PostgreSQL logical driver MVP, OpenAPI coverage, an operations overview API, and an embedded React/Tailwind WebUI shell.

The project is still in active implementation. The architectural foundation is in place and heavily tested, while broader database driver coverage and some product surfaces described in `.project/IMPLEMENTATION.md` remain roadmap work.

## High-Level System

Kronos is organized as one static Go binary with multiple operating modes:

- `kronos server` runs the control plane.
- `kronos agent --work` runs a worker that claims and executes jobs.
- `kronos local --work` can run a local embedded control plane and worker.
- Administrative commands use the same binary and can operate locally or against the server API.

## Control-Plane Request Path

The control plane is built directly on `net/http`. Persistent mode opens `state.db`, creates typed stores, seeds resources from config, starts the scheduler loop, and serves `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`, `/api/v1/*`, `/api/v1/overview`, and the embedded WebUI. Health, readiness, metrics, and overview endpoints accept both `GET` and `HEAD` so probes can verify availability without transferring response bodies.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

    participant HTTP as Control-plane HTTP mux
    participant Auth as Token verifier

    HTTP->>Notify: terminal job webhook fanout
    HTTP->>Audit: append mutation event
    Audit->>KV: hash-chained append
    HTTP-->>User: JSON response
```

    Overview --> Jobs[Job store]
    Overview --> Backups[Backup store]
    Overview --> Inventory[Targets, storage, schedules, policies, notifications, users]
    Overview --> Summary[Compact JSON dashboard summary]
```

## Job Lifecycle

Jobs are persisted in the embedded store so scheduled and manual work survives restarts. On startup, active jobs are failed as `server_lost`; during scheduler ticks, jobs assigned to stale agents can be failed as `agent_lost`.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> queued: schedule tick or manual enqueue
    queued --> running: agent claim
    running --> finalizing: data uploaded, metadata commit starts
    finalizing --> succeeded: backup/restore committed
    running --> succeeded: terminal report
    running --> failed: executor error
    running --> canceled: user cancel
    queued --> canceled: user cancel
    failed --> queued: retry
    canceled --> queued: retry
    succeeded --> [*]
    failed --> [*]
    canceled --> [*]
```

## Scheduler And Dispatch

Schedules use cron expressions, `@between` windows, stable jitter, catch-up policies, and per-target queueing. The server-side scheduler loop turns due schedules into durable queued jobs, and workers claim jobs through the control-plane API.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Schedules[ScheduleStore]
    States[ScheduleStateStore]
    Backups[BackupStore]
    Runner[SchedulerRunner]
    Orchestrator[Orchestrator]
    Jobs[(JobStore)]
    Agents[AgentRegistry]
    Worker[Agent worker]

    Runner -->|due jobs| Orchestrator
    Orchestrator --> Jobs
    Agents -->|capacity and liveness| Jobs
    Worker -->|claim| Jobs
    Worker -->|finish| Jobs
```

## Backup Data Path

The backup path is streaming-first. A driver emits logical records, the engine serializes them as JSON lines, and the chunk pipeline performs content-defined chunking, BLAKE3 hashing, deduplication, compression, encryption, upload, and manifest reference generation.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    DB[(Database)]
    Driver[Driver.BackupFull or BackupIncremental]
    Records[Logical records as JSON lines]
    FastCDC[FastCDC content-defined chunks]
    Hash[BLAKE3 hash]
    Dedup{Already indexed?}
    Compress[Compress gzip/zstd/auto]
    Encrypt[AEAD envelope]
    Upload[Upload object]
    Ref[ChunkRef]
    Manifest[Signed manifest]
    Repo[(Storage repository)]
    State[(Backup metadata store)]

    DB --> Driver
    Driver --> Records
    Records --> FastCDC
    FastCDC --> Hash
    Hash --> Dedup
    Dedup -->|yes| Ref
    Dedup -->|no| Compress
    Compress --> Encrypt
    Encrypt --> Upload
    Upload --> Ref
    Ref --> Manifest
    Manifest --> Repo
    Manifest --> State
```

## Chunk Pipeline Worker Graph

The pipeline uses bounded channels and worker groups. References are sorted by sequence before the final manifest is committed, preserving the original stream order even when hash, encode, and upload work happens concurrently.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Input[io.Reader]
    Chunker[chunk goroutine]
    HashWorkers[hash workers]
    EncodeWorkers[encode workers]
    UploadWorkers[upload workers]
    Refs[ordered ChunkRefs]

    Input --> Chunker
    Chunker -->|PipelineChunk| HashWorkers
    HashWorkers -->|HashedChunk| EncodeWorkers
    EncodeWorkers -->|EncodedChunk| UploadWorkers
    UploadWorkers -->|ChunkRef| Refs
```

## Restore Data Path

Restore planning validates the backup parent chain before work is enqueued. The agent reconstructs chunk references from storage, decrypts and decompresses payloads, verifies content hashes, and streams records back into the target driver.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as Operator
    participant API as Control plane
    participant Planner as Restore planner
    participant Worker as Agent worker
    participant Repo as Storage backend
    participant Pipeline as Chunk pipeline
    participant Driver as Database driver
    participant DB as Target database

    User->>API: restore preview/start
    API->>Planner: validate backup chain
    Planner-->>API: restore plan
    API-->>Worker: queued restore job
    Worker->>Repo: load manifests and chunks
    Repo-->>Pipeline: encrypted/compressed payloads
    Pipeline->>Pipeline: decrypt, decompress, hash verify
    Pipeline-->>Driver: logical records
    Driver->>DB: restore records
    Worker->>API: finish succeeded/failed
```

## Metadata Model

The persisted control-plane model is intentionally small and operational. Immutable backup payloads live in object storage, while mutable operational metadata lives in `state.db`.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    TARGET ||--o{ SCHEDULE : has
    STORAGE ||--o{ SCHEDULE : receives
    SCHEDULE ||--o{ JOB : enqueues
    TARGET ||--o{ JOB : runs_against
    STORAGE ||--o{ JOB : writes_to
    JOB ||--o| BACKUP : produces
    BACKUP ||--o{ BACKUP : parent_chain
    RETENTION_POLICY ||--o{ SCHEDULE : applies_to
    USER ||--o{ TOKEN : owns
    USER ||--o{ AUDIT_EVENT : acts

    TARGET {
      string id
      string driver
      string endpoint
    }
    STORAGE {
      string id
      string kind
      string uri
    }
    SCHEDULE {
      string id
      string expression
      bool paused
    }
    JOB {
      string id
      string operation
      string status
      string agent_id
    }
    BACKUP {
      string id
      string manifest_id
      string parent_id
      bool protected
    }
    RETENTION_POLICY {
      string id
      string rules
    }
    USER {
      string id
      string role
    }
    TOKEN {
      string id
      string scopes
    }
    AUDIT_EVENT {
      int seq
      string prev_hash
      string hash
    }
```

## Storage Layout

Kronos separates operational state from repository objects:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph StateDB[state.db]
        KVJobs[jobs]
        KVTargets[targets]
        KVStorages[storages]
        KVSchedules[schedules]
        KVBackups[backups]
        KVUsers[users]
        KVTokens[tokens]
        KVAudit[audit events]
    end

    subgraph Repo[Object repository]
        Chunks[chunks by content hash/key]
        Manifests[manifests/YYYY/MM/DD/backup.manifest]
    end

    KVBackups -->|manifest_id/key| Manifests
    Manifests -->|chunk references| Chunks
```

## Security And Integrity

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Token[Bearer token]
    Scope[Exact scope, resource:*, admin:*, or *]
    Role[User role caps issued scopes]
    API[API mutation]
    Audit[Hash-chained audit event]

    Signing[Ed25519 manifest signing]
    Manifest[Manifest bytes]
    Verify[Signature verification]

    ChunkKey[32-byte chunk key]
    AEAD[AEAD encryption envelope]
    Hash[BLAKE3 chunk hash]
    Chunk[Stored chunk]

    Token --> Scope --> API --> Audit
    Role --> Scope
    Signing --> Manifest --> Verify
    ChunkKey --> AEAD --> Chunk
    Chunk --> Hash
    Hash --> Verify
```

Key points:

- API tokens are stored as hashed verifiers; bearer secrets are shown once.
- Token scopes are checked on protected endpoints.
- API, health, readiness, and metrics responses are marked `Cache-Control:
  no-store`; WebUI HTML revalidates while fingerprinted assets are immutable;
  API and WebUI responses carry baseline browser security headers.
- Manifest signing keys and chunk encryption keys are separate.
- Chunk-level verification decrypts, decompresses, and hashes payloads.
- Administrative mutations can be recorded in a hash-chained audit log.

## Embedded KV Store

The control plane uses a pure-Go embedded key-value store rather than an external database. It is page-based, bucketed, protected by rollback WAL, and has repair coverage.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    StoreAPI[Typed stores]
    Buckets[Logical buckets]
    BTree[B+Tree]
    Pager[Pager]
    WAL[Rollback WAL]
    File[(state.db)]

    StoreAPI --> Buckets
    Buckets --> BTree
    BTree --> Pager
    Pager --> WAL
    Pager --> File
```

## Build And Verification Pipeline

The repository is Go-first, with the WebUI built separately and embedded into the Go binary.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Go[Go packages]
    Tests[go test ./...]
    Vet[go vet ./...]
    Static[staticcheck if installed]

    Go --> Tests
    Go --> Vet
    Go --> Static

## Roadmap Gaps

The current codebase has a solid backbone, but several areas are intentionally incomplete or still early:

    Gaps --> Notifications[Notifications, hooks, and routing]
    Gaps --> WebDepth[Full WebUI workflows beyond dashboard shell]
    Gaps --> E2E[End-to-end integration environments]
```

Recommended next engineering slices:

1. Extend PostgreSQL hardening around broader upgrade rehearsal evidence.
2. Expand database driver coverage to MongoDB.
3. Deepen the WebUI from operational dashboard shell into resource CRUD and job detail workflows.
4. Add storage backend parity for the domain-level kinds already present in `core.StorageKind`.
5. Harden production auth, token lifecycle, and audit coverage around every mutation.
